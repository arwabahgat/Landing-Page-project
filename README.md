*Landing page project

-Description:
Creating the js code for landing page in the professional track in the web development nanodegree from udacity.

-Reviewed the content of the course to make sure of understanding some content to begin testing the knowledge I learned so far in the course.

-while writing the code i read some documentation on websites, “MDN web docs” and "w3schools", about:
<nav> element
HTML data-* Attribute
<a>: The Anchor element
Element.getBoundingClientRect()
HTML DOM classList Property
JavaScript HTML DOM EventListener

-first I added 4th section in the html
-then I linked the js file to the HTML index file
-I run each part separately in the console in the developer tools to check if it is run properly.
-after finishing I checked the Rubric to make sure that I covered all the requirements
